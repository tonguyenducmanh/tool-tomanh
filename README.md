## Project: Developer Utility Tools - Aggregated to Avoid Deploying Each Tool on a Separate Site

This project provides a collection of useful tools for developers, aggregated with the aim of avoiding the need to deploy each tool on a separate website.

Two versions are supported: web version (Vue + Vite) and app version (Electron + Vue + Vite).

Application-wide configuration can be accessed by entering the following command in the console:

```
window.__env
```

Global objects are injected in the `renderer.js` file, for example: `$tdCache = import TDCache.js`, `$tdEnum = import TDEnum.js`.

The `[mock.js](src/common/mock/mock.js)` file will be used to fake data for each tool.
